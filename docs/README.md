The `docs` directory contains four key documents:
- `proposal_anikesanapally_biol4220_F2022.pdf` is a short description/proposal of what I intend to do in this pipeline project initially.
- `dataset_proposal_anikesanapally_biol4220_F2022.fasta` is the seven sequence data set that I propose to explore as an example in this pipeline project.
- `manual_anikesanapally_biol4220_F2022.pdf` is a manual that explains how to use my pipeline.
- `report_anikesanapally_biol4220_F2022.pdf` is a report that summarizes considerations, triumphs, and frustrations I encountered when designing my pipeline.
- `slides_anikesanapally_biol4220_F2022.pdf` are the slides for my presentation to share my project with the class in pdf format.
